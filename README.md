# Chess-Game

## Description
This is a chess game that I programmed. It was part of an assignment for my Introduction to Programming in Java course with Professor Harold Connamacher. There are still some issues with it, so this project still is a work in progress. I implemented the Java Swing library for graphics and deisgned the chess hireachy for an efficient way to move/ check the pieces.
